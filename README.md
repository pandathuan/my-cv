# CV Something in latin beginning with C and V

## Summary

I am a highly experienced Software Architect and Senior Software Engineer with over 15 years of expertise in PHP development, specializing in eCommerce platforms and content management systems. My technical proficiency includes building scalable, maintainable, and high-performance web applications with a strong focus on data integration, API development, and best coding practices. I am well-versed in modern web technologies, including CSS3, Bootstrap, jQuery, and HTML5, ensuring the development of dynamic and user-friendly digital solutions.

My journey in PHP development began in 2007, where I honed my skills in object-oriented programming and MVC frameworks through self-directed learning. I quickly became adept at developing extensible, maintainable solutions and adapting to new technologies.

From 2009 to 2010, I started my professional career as a PHP and CakePHP trainee developer at SmartOSC, where I customized modules for Mantis Bug Tracker and initiated research on Magento 1. Following that, I joined JoomlArt, focusing on Joomla CMS development, creating custom modules, and providing technical support for Joomla-based themes and extensions.

Between 2011 and 2020, I served as a Technical Leader and Product Owner at BrainOS, where I led the development of core theme modules for Prestashop, OpenCart, Magento 1, and Magento 2. I managed multiple customization projects, built Magento extensions and themes, and oversaw the successful execution of numerous large-scale eCommerce solutions.

In 2020, I shifted focus to the development of an Order Management System and an automation fulfillment system for the print-on-demand (POD) industry, utilizing Node.js, React.js, and MongoDB.

Currently, as a freelance Magento 2/Adobe Commerce/ Shopify/ SaaS specialist , I continue to refine my expertise in eCommerce solutions. I am eager to further expand my technical and managerial skills, taking on larger-scale projects and leading high-performing development teams in complex, multi-vendor environments.
